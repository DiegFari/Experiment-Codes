  <strong>Your data have been collected succesfully!</strong>
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong>We wish to inform you about the actual purpose of this experiment: </strong>
  The real purpose of this experiment was investigating the effect of anonymity perception vs non-anonymity perception on the behavior of the respondent. In
  fact, what we have been tracking throughout the whole experiment is the mouse tracking of the respondent during the decision-making process.
  <br />
  <br />
  This means that, whatever instruction you have received at the beggining of the experiment, we ensure you now that you personal data have not been collected
  and <strong>your responses and data were completely anonymous</strong>
  <br />

  THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS EXPERIMENT
