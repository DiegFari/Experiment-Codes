  <strong>We wish to inform you about the actual purpose of this study:</strong>
  <br />
  The real purpose of this study was not to check habits in regard to AI chatbot interaction and privacy, but to investigate the effect of
  <strong>anonymity perception</strong> on a respondent while answering questions in a survey. Some participants of this survey were prompted to answer honestly
  and assured their answers would be kept anonymous, while others were asked for more personal information and not told their answers would be anonymous.
  However, no matter what instructions you received at the beginning of the study, we ensure you now that your personal data has not been collected and
  <strong>your responses were completely anonymous</strong>.

  Thank you once again for your participation! If you have any feedback or remarks you would like to share, please feel free to send them via email.
